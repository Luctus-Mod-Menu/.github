## üìñ Overview

Luctus is designed as a punishing, immersive experience. But sometimes you want to bend the rules‚Äîskip the grind, test builds instantly, or experiment with wild scenarios. The mod menu makes it possible, transforming the game into a **sandbox playground** where you set the challenge.
